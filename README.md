DeepSupport is a multi-mode companion for supportive dialogue:

- 🫂 **DeepSupport Warm** is an emotional-holding companion that offers gentle support without rushing into what to do next.

- 🧂 **DeepSupport Tsukkomi** is a wry roast-and-reframe companion that uses deadpan humor to help you vent, zoom out, and regain perspective without forcing “serious advice mode”.

- 🌐 **DeepSupport Real** is a calibrated reality-check companion that anchors the conversation in constraints and facts while keeping the tone protective and steady.

- 🌪️ **DeepSupport Gonzo** is a high-dimensional insight companion that uses wild, poetic analogies to untangle complex feelings and reveal the hidden structure of a messy situation.

- 🧑‍🏫 **DeepSupport Coach** is a problem-clarification and action-planning companion that turns vague blockages into concrete next steps.

Different personas take turns to keep you moving in the same messy world.
