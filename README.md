# DeepSupport <img src="brand_mark.png" alt="DeepSupport logo" height="30">

DeepSupport is a multi-mode companion for supportive dialogue:

- 🫂 **DeepSupport Warm** is an emotional-holding companion that offers gentle support without rushing into what to do next.

- 🧂 **DeepSupport Tsukkomi** is a wry roast-and-reframe companion that uses deadpan humor to help you vent, zoom out, and regain perspective without forcing serious advice mode.

- 🌐 **DeepSupport Real** is a calibrated reality-check companion that anchors the conversation in constraints and facts while keeping the tone protective and steady.

- 🌪️ **DeepSupport Gonzo** is a high-dimensional insight companion that uses wild, poetic analogies to untangle complex feelings and reveal the hidden structure of a messy situation.

- 🧑‍🏫 **DeepSupport Coach** is a problem-clarification and action-planning companion that turns vague blockages into concrete next steps.

Different personas take turns to keep you moving in the same messy world.

## Availability 💡

- The OSS releases do not ship any private datasets or real chat logs.

- DeepSupport Warm is best used with [the fine-tuned LoRA adapter](https://huggingface.co/Yukyin/deepsupport-warm-lora-oss).

- DeepSupport Tsukkomi, Real, Gonzo are highly dependent on their training data, so they are not open-sourced for now.  They will be exposed later via an interface.

- DeepSupport Coach is a prompt-based method best with in-context learning data and requires no additional training.

- [UPDATE!] We now open-source a representative sample of the dataset, including 62 dialogue pairs across all five personas, with Chinese–English parallel annotations at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yukyin/DeepSupport.




## Disclaimer ⚠️

- DeepSupport does not provide professional advice, diagnosis, or therapy. 

- It provides supportive conversation and perspective in its own style. Please seek qualified professional help when needed.
